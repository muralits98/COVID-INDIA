# COVID-INDIA
This repo contains the daily dataset of COVID spread in India from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

Visualization here: https://muralits98.github.io/COVID-INDIA/

I noticed that there was no means to access historical data of the COVID Statistics in India and decided to keep track of it here. I wrote a script that will automatically pull the data and upload it here. I will update the dataset every day to keep track of the spread in India with the dataset from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
